      <p class="govuk-body">
        Integrating with our <a href="recruitment-api-documentation" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Recruitment API</a> may be useful if you want to create adverts using your existing systems. It will allow you to publish to multiple sites, as well as <a href="#" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Find an apprenticeship</a>.
        <br><br>
        You can also use the <a href="display-adverts-api-documentation" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Display adverts API</a> to display adverts on any website.  
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What does the API do?</h2> 
      <p class="govuk-body">
        APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let applications share information and data with each other.
        <br><br>
        If you connect using our <a href="recruitment-api-documentation" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Recruitment API</a>, you can use your own systems to create adverts on <a href="#" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Find an apprenticeship</a>. 
        <br><br>
        You can also use our <a href="display-adverts-api-documentation" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Display adverts API</a> to display your adverts on any website.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I use the API?</h2> 
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        You'll need someone with technical knowledge to connect your software program with the API, for example a software developer. 
      </div>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can share this <a href="api-list" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">API page</a> with the person who is going to connect your software program with the API.         
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        It can take a while to connect using an API, so leave enough time to integrate it.
