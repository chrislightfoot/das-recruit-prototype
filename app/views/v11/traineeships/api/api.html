    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What do our APIs do?</h2> 
    <p class="govuk-body">
      APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let applications share information and data with each other.
      <br><br>
      We have two APIs you can use:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Recruitment API</strong> &ndash; our Recruitment API allows you to create vacancies on Find an apprenticeship using your own systems</li>
      <li><strong>Display adverts API</strong> &ndash; our Display adverts API allows you to display vacancies from Find an apprenticeship on your own websites</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I use the APIs?</h2> 
    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      You'll need someone with technical knowledge to connect your system with the API, for example a software developer.
    </div>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can share this <a href="../../guidance/get-started#working-together" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">developer get started page</a> with the person who is going to connect your system with the API, they can access the API from there.             
      <br><br>
      You will need to give your developer API keys. The keys give your developer permission to connect to the API on your behalf.
      <br><br>
      Your developer will also be able to try out the API using the sandbox provided.
      <br><br>
      If you want to create vacancies for employers using the API you will need them to give you permission to create vacancies on their behalf, they can do this in their Apprenticeship service account. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Where do I access the API Key?</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you have owner permissions you will be able to access the <a href="api-list" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">API keys here</a>. 
    </p>
